Below is an explanation of the folder structure tailored for your restaurant POS system—with special emphasis on how it supports individual staff accounts and ensures that every sale (order) is saved with its associated staff member.

Detailed Explanation with Staff Accounts in Mind

1. /src/app/pos – The POS Interface for Staff

Purpose:
This area is dedicated to the staff who will be handling orders. Each staff member logs in (via the authentication API under /src/app/api/auth) and sees their personalized dashboard.

Key Pages:

Dashboard (page.tsx):
Displays active orders, menu items, and any quick-access tools for taking orders.

Orders (/orders/):

List Page: Displays all orders made by the logged-in staff member.

Detail Page ([id]/page.tsx): Shows complete details of a specific order, including which staff member created it.


Menu (/menu/):
Provides a list of available menu items that can be added to an order.

Customers (/customers/):
Manages customer lookup for the loyalty system so that the current staff member can attach a sale to a customer account.

Settings (/settings/):
Contains options specific to the POS (e.g., interface preferences, payment options).


Staff Association:
When a staff member creates an order, the system captures the staff member’s ID (managed in the global state, e.g., via useOrderStore.ts) and includes it with the order data. The API endpoint for orders in /src/app/api/orders/route.ts is then responsible for saving this information to the database.



---

2. /src/app/admin – The Owner Dashboard

Purpose:
The owner dashboard provides an overview of the restaurant’s operations. It includes sales analytics, overall order history (which can be filtered by staff), menu management, and loyalty program oversight.

Key Pages:

Dashboard (page.tsx):
A high-level summary of sales, revenue, and loyalty statistics.

Analytics (/analytics):
Detailed reports including charts and graphs showing staff performance, total orders, and loyalty metrics.

Menu Management (/menu):
Allows the owner to manage the restaurant’s menu offerings.

Order History (/orders):
Provides a complete log of all orders. The owner can see which staff member handled each order.

Customer & Loyalty Management (/customers):
Lets the owner view customer profiles and loyalty transactions, enabling better insights into the fidelity system.




---

3. /src/app/api – The Backend API

Purpose:
This folder contains all the API endpoints that power your app. It ensures a single source of truth for data management, whether an order is placed from the POS or viewed on the admin dashboard.

Key Subfolders:

Menu (/api/menu):
Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting menu items.

Orders (/api/orders):
Endpoints that process orders. When an order is created, the API records details such as the order items, total amount, and importantly, the staff member’s ID who processed the order.

Customers (/api/customers):
Endpoints for handling customer data and managing loyalty transactions (earning or redeeming points).

Auth (/api/auth):
Endpoints to manage authentication (login, logout, session validation) to ensure that each staff member logs in securely and their actions are tracked.




---

4. /src/components, /src/hooks, /src/lib, and /src/store – The Building Blocks

Components (/components):
Reusable UI components such as the navigation bar, order cards, or menu item cards. These components are used in both the POS and admin areas.

Custom Hooks (/hooks):
Encapsulate API calls and business logic. For example, a hook like useOrders.ts manages fetching orders, posting new orders (with staff IDs attached), and updating order statuses.

Utilities (/lib):
Helper functions and configurations (e.g., a Prisma client instance to interact with the database).

Global State (/store):
Uses a state management solution (like Zustand) to manage application-wide state. For example, useOrderStore.ts keeps track of the current order session—including which staff member is logged in—so that each order is properly associated with that staff account.

5. Managing Staff Accounts in the System

Authentication and Staff Data:
With the authentication API endpoints in /api/auth and potentially an additional model in your Prisma schema (e.g., a Staff model), each staff member logs in to the POS. Their session data (staff ID, role, etc.) is stored in global state (or through cookies/sessions via NextAuth).

Order Association:
Every time a staff member creates an order, the POS interface uses the logged-in user’s information from the global state and sends it along with the order data. This ensures that when the order is saved via the /api/orders endpoint, it includes the staff member’s ID.

Role-Based Access:
The owner dashboard (admin area) can include role-based views to show a filtered order history by staff. This makes it easier to analyze performance, track sales, and manage accountability.

Summary

The /src/app/pos directory hosts all the POS-specific pages and components that staff members interact with.

The /src/app/admin directory is designed for the owner’s dashboard, providing oversight and management tools.

The /src/app/api folder is the backend of your application, ensuring that all data—orders, menu items, customer loyalty transactions, and staff actions—is handled consistently.

Reusable components, custom hooks, and state management are separated into their own folders, allowing you to maintain a clean and modular codebase.

Finally, staff authentication and session management are integrated into the system so that every order is linked to the specific staff member who processed it, ensuring accountability and accurate tracking.


This structure not only keeps your code organized but also provides clear separation of concerns—making it easier to manage user accounts (for staff), process orders, and track loyalty transactions throughout your restaurant POS system.
